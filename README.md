Numbers Quiz
====

If you're learning a foreign language, you might fall behind with remembering how to say different numbers beyond just one through ten. Numbers Quiz is an flashcard-style iOS app that lets you quickly and easily memorize how to say numbers in Spanish, French, and German. 

You can choose whatever specific range of numbers to memorize, such as 1 to 10, 10 to 100, or 123 to 4321. Basically anything from 0 to 10,000 works.

## Usage

Open NumbersQuiz.xcodeproj using Xcode on an OS X machine. You can run the app using the simulator or on your iOS device if you are an Apple Developer.

##Technical Details

The app was written in Objective-C on Xcode. The translations for each number are not generated, but are instead stored statically in a premade SQLite database.
